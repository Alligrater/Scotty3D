# Animation Overview

There are four primary components that must be implemented to support Animation functionality.

##A4.0
- [(Task 1) Spline Interpolation](camera_rays.md)
- [(Task 2) Skeleton Kinematics](intersecting_objects.md)
##A4.5
- Soon to come

Each of these components is described at the linked page.

Additionally, the assignment specification asks you to create a video of your animation. Some brief technical notes on creating videos from images are [here](generate_videos.md).
