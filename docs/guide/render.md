# Render

Welcome! This is Scotty3D's realistic, globally illuminated pathtracing renderer, capable of creating images of complex scenes using path tracing.

## Moving Camera

## Create light

To create a lighting for your scene, simply go to the menu on the left side, click "New Light", and you will be able to choose from a variaty of light objects and environmental lights. (you will implement the support for environmental light in Task 7. See the corresponding documentation for more guide.)
